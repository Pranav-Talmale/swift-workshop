## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
print("Name won't change at all, so it should be a const.")
let name: String
print("Age will increase every year, so declare it as variable.")
var age: Int
print("Number of steps taken will change each day, so declare it as a variable")
var numberOfStepsTakenToday: Int
print("Goal steps will be constant, so declare it as a variable")
let goalNumberOfSteps: Int
print("Average heart rate will change with every scan, so declare it as a variable")
var averageHeartRate: Int

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
